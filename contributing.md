## Publishing to npm

This project has a generated changelog. This process could eventually be
automated, but for now there are some manual steps:

1. Edit `package.json`, setting `version` to the upcoming release number.
1. Run `npm run changelog`. This will update `changelog.md` and revert your `version` changes in `package.json`.
1. Verify that `changelog.md` looks right.
1. Commit changes: `git commit -m "update changelog"`
1. Create a git tag for the upcoming version using `npm version patch|minor|major -m "new stuff"`
1. `npm publish`
1. `git push origin master --follow-tags`
